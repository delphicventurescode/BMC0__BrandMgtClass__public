# Tech Tip: Use Notion AI to Streamline Your Course Notes

**What it is:**  
[Notion AI](https://www.notion.so/product/ai) is an intelligent workspace that helps you capture, organize, and summarize your ideas in one place. It’s perfect for managing your Brand Management coursework, projects, and reflections.

**Why it’s useful for students:**  
- Automatically summarizes readings or lecture notes.  
- Lets you build simple databases to track assignments or deadlines.  
- Integrates AI to generate outlines, study guides, or even marketing briefs.  
- Everything stays synced — across laptop, tablet, and phone.

**Pro Tip:**  
After each class, paste your notes into Notion and ask its AI to “summarize the key takeaways in bullet points.” You’ll build a revision-friendly summary bank over the semester.
